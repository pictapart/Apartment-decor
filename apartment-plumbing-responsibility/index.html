<p>Depending on where the plumbing issue is located, it may be the responsibility of the hoa or board members, or it may be something the unit owner has to have repaired. However, there are cases where the leak comes from a pipe that serves both your units. This is true even if the fault is due to the way a particular feature was installed and the landlord did not know of the problem. The major responsibility of condo boards in condo buildings is to the building as a while over individual units.</p>
<h3 id="most-people-in-todays-society-arent-aware-of-the-rights-of-tenants-and-landlords-nor-are-they-familiar-with-areas-of-the-law-dealing-with-property-maintenance">Most people in today’s society aren’t aware of the rights of tenants and landlords, nor are they familiar with areas of the law dealing with property maintenance.</h3><p>The responsibility should be in your lease a good lease agreement will outline the roles and responsibilities of both the tenant and the landlord, clearly stating what each must do. So plumbing problems that occur outside the units, like drainage away from the building and connections to the municipal water, are still the responsibility of the board over the individual. The landlord is also responsible for providing adequate heat in the cold months, air conditioning in the warm months (if the unit has central air conditioning) and hot water. The supply of electricity is the owners corporation’s. Our simple team provides service with a smile, understanding, compassion and a good attitude. This depends on whether the burst pipe is in the boundary wall or not.</p>
