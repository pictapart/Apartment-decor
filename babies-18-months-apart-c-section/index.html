<p>I had my son last june and he was an emergency c section due to low fluid. A vbac 18 months after first c section: I bled and then it almost stopped and then it came back heavily. Infant care (up to 18 months old) &gt; p &gt; period after a c section;</p>
<h3 id="your-kids-are-going-to-flail-and-throw-all-manner-of-big-emotions-at-you">Your kids are going to flail and throw all manner of big emotions at you.</h3><p>Its only been 9 months and will be 18 months when its time for the birth. But, it was due to the baby being in distress, not because the pregnancies were so close together. That was all fine until i got pregnant. To reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and other health problems, research suggests waiting 18 to 24 months but less than five years after a live birth before attempting your next pregnancy. I had a baby c section 8 weeks ago and i had the same thing. Infant care (up to 18 months old) &gt; p &gt; period after a c section;</p>
