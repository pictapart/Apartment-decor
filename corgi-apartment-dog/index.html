<p>Corgis are willful, animated dogs with a good sense of humor. Regardless of the type of corgi, they are cute, cheerful, energetic, and fun to live with. Corgis are watchful dogs, so they do well in an apartment with windows where they can watch the street outside. Since they’re high energy, you’ll need to take them out for several walks.</p>

<p>Apartment buildings vary, though, so be sure to check with your landlord before you bring home a corgi or move. Perhaps because of their association with the queen, these.

<p>If they live in an apartment, they need room to stretch their little legs daily to get out all that pent up energy. Their best situation is an owner who can take them on long walks and lives near a dog park, but they still work in small. Corgis are watchful dogs, so they do well in an apartment with.</p>

<p>Are corgis good apartment dogs, or should you consider getting a different breed?
