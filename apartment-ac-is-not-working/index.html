<p>If your ac unit breaks down, you may have some hoops to jump through to get your landlord to prioritize its repair. Request letter for change of office ac unit. The same goes for your heat.

<p>If you’re not making much progress, you’ll want to call an hvac technician to service your unit right away for a thorough cleaning.
