<h3 id="the-correct-location-for-a-circulator-installed-on-a-closed-hot-water-heating-system-is-the-supply-side-of-the-boiler-not-the-return-side">The correct location for a circulator installed on a closed hot water heating system is the supply side of the boiler, not the return side.</h3><p>If there is no warmth at all on the radiator, you’ll need to be sure that the thermostaticradiator valve and the lockshield valve on the other side are both open. We�ll show you how to get the one radiator hot again. Got a leaking radiator valve now? The radiator did get hot years ago, but it has not been working well the past couple years.
