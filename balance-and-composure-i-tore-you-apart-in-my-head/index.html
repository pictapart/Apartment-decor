A haunting reminder of when. I tore you apart in my head / locked up in my room again / left you for broken and there you were choking / you got. And it�s not me in this head crippled with regret i can say it was the last time but i know it�s not the last time what does this all mean i�m lost now somewhere in between and i can say it was the last time but i know it�s not the last time your breathing gets shorter your hands are getting cold but you can�t die here you�re only nineteen. You got me humming right along.</p>
