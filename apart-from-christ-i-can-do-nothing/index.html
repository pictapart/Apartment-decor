<p>He cuts off the branches that never bear any fruit because they do not abide in him (john 15:6). Anything of life must be of christ. Allow the truth of god’s word to saturate your heart and guide your steps in the coming year. Abiding in christ isn’t “extra” power for god’s work, it’s the only power for god’s work..</p>
