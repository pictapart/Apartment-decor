<p>If the paint has thickened over time, thin it down with a thinner or water. I did that for an apartment i had. In this video i will show you the technique to use when touch. Keep the idea of repainting the entire wall as a last resort that you’ll (hopefully) never have to use.</p>
<h3 id="then-fill-any-holes-in-the-wall-with-spackle-so-you039ll-be-painting-over-an-even-surface">Then, fill any holes in the wall with spackle so you�ll be painting over an even surface.</h3><p>Just make sure you don�t gouge out the wall! The remaining paint from an exterior paint job is probably no longer a clean match on a wall even if it is only 12 months. Start to stretch too far and you’ll probably find yourself unhappy with how it looks. To touch up paint on a wall, start by cleaning the area with a multipurpose cleaner to get rid of any dirt and grime. Most landlords should be happy to provide you with some paint to touch up your place at any time during your residency, and asking for it shows pride in ownership, which all landlords appreciate. If you can prove the landlord acted in bad faith you may recover up to twice the amount of the security deposit.</p>
