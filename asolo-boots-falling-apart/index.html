<p>I switched to lowa and vasque boots after that i was done with asolo boots. The second boot to bite the dust was a $250.00 pair of the asolo expedition boots with the pulley eyelets. Rocky hunting boots beware they fall apart ! Plus a little spot on the left side of the right boot was doing the same.</p>

Asolo are for serious hikers and outdoorsmen while you have to have a little $$$ to afford them. Asolo is an italian company; So looking forward to the next 15 years on these great constructed boots. I had a pair of the boots picture at left and after about 6 months the front of the right boot started to delaminate and pull off. Sole repair would be the same price as the boots.</p>

<p>So looking forward to the next 15 years on these great constructed boots. As noted below, while other brands also use the polyurethane midsole. Plus a little spot on the left side of the right boot was doing the same. I got a pair of high rubber itasca�s that work great for me past two ,three years. Big gaping hole.</p>

<p>Asolo is an italian company; I also had bought mine at sierra trading post. We hiked in the mud everyday,never a problem with wet feet. I would never buy a pair of boots and expect to last the equivalent of 10 weekend outings. In case you find that your boots are affected by hydrolysis, all is not lost.</p>

<p>I would never buy a pair of boots and expect to last the equivalent of 10 weekend outings. All that i have now are an old pair of sketchers shoes that are falling apart and my steel toed gortex leather work boots. Regardless of how much use the boots receive. So, when hiking boots fail, it is a complete disaster,.</p>

<p>So, when hiking boots fail, it is a complete disaster, rivaling only a backpack ripping apart and spilling its contents in the backcountry. I bought vasque wasatch but after reading some terrible reviews of them falling apart after 25 miles (yeah, pathetic huh?), i�ve returned them and i need new ones. The rubber sidewall right at the joint of the.</p>

<p>Gluing the sole on on the trail is not easy. It needs a lot of pressure to keep the sole in contact with the rest of the shoe. I am replacing a pair that were 15 years old and the best. Plus the soles still had some life to. The second boot to bite the dust was a $250.00 pair.</p>

<p>I also had bought mine at sierra trading post. A molded polyurethane (pu) midsole absorbs moisture over time and one day suddenly falls apart. Rocky hunting boots beware they fall apart ! Cemented construction is a traditional and complex shoemaking technique, where the upper is worked over the insole on a last before the outsole is attached. Asolo is an.</p>

<p>Asolo footwears are made with cemented construction and can easily be resoled with a brand new midsole and outsole. I would have expected many more miles out of them for a $240 boot. We hiked in the mud everyday,never a problem with wet feet. After putting on approximately 70 miles the cuff around the top is tearing from the boot,.</p>

<p>Of all emergency glues, gorilla glue worked best. Asolo footwears are made with cemented construction and can easily be resoled with a brand new midsole and outsole. Asolo is an italian company; The asolos have an obvious defect. Wash off muck and manure with water at the end of the trip.</p>

<p>The rubber sidewall right at the joint of the heel and the forefoot blew out. The asolo fugitive gtx has excellent ankle support and a rigid outsole for stability, but not so rigid you feel like you�re walking on frostbitten feet. The second boot to bite the dust was a $250.00 pair of the asolo expedition boots with the pulley.</p>

<p>The lacing system is very adjustable for foot shape and individual tightness preference, and the laces are long enough. I didn�t use the boots very much over the years, it�s like the rubber experienced dry rot and collapsed.

<p>Asolo fit me funny with a very flat arch. I bought vasque wasatch but after reading some terrible reviews of them falling apart after 25 miles (yeah, pathetic huh?), i�ve returned them and i need new ones. I switched to lowa and vasque boots after that i was done with asolo boots. Don�t know where they used to make their.</p>

<p>The vibram clusaz can be used to resole scarpa, asolo meindl, zamberlan and other hiking boots. Again, 300 miles on a $200 pair of boots is pathetic. Of all emergency glues, gorilla glue worked best. So i want something durable and protective like my work boots yet comfortable like my shoes. I didn�t use the boots very much over the.</p>

<p>I�m looking at vasque sundowner and asolo sasslong but i�ve read that they�re now manufactured in china and made of poor material. Keep your boots away from surfaces of heat. I wore my asolo boots this past elk hunt, seven days of rain. I believe asolo boots are the best &amp; most comfortable on the market! Here’s some examples of.</p>

<p>I was recommended asolo fugitive gtx boots by a close buddy of mine that is an arborist and is on his 5th pair of these since 2007!? I also had bought mine at sierra trading post. Cemented construction is a traditional and complex shoemaking technique, where the upper is worked over the insole on a last before the outsole is.</p>

<p>I am a hiker with 30 years experience and have never ever owned a boot that fell apart, soles delaminating, so suddenly and dramatically on the trail. The tps 520 gv evo leather hiking boot by asolo® has a tough yet comfortable leather design, excellent waterproof protection, and reliable traction that makes it ideal for backpacking, trekking on technical terrains,.</p>

<p>Sole repair would be the same price as the boots. Wondering why your shoes are falling apart even though the sole looks brand spanking new? Don�t know where they used to make their boots, but now many of them are being made in romania, so quite possible their quality and qc has gone downhill. Regardless of how much use the.</p>

<p>I bought vasque wasatch but after reading some terrible reviews of them falling apart after 25 miles (yeah, pathetic huh?), i�ve returned them and i need new ones. October 16, 2014 | updated oct 12, 2015. So, when hiking boots fail, it is a complete disaster, rivaling only a backpack ripping apart and spilling its contents in the backcountry. Wondering.</p>
