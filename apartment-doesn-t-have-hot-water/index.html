<p>Find it and fix it. What can i do if my apartment doesn�t have hot water? If it doesn’t solve the problem at the end, i’d recommend calling your landlord (if you have one) or calling a plumber. Withhold their rent to make the repair on their own if there is no response from their written request for hot water.</p>

<p>What the law says about hot water at work. Failure to fix the problem in a reasonable time is typically a violation of the lease and often, a violation of local housing regulations. If it doesn’t solve the problem at the end, i’d recommend calling your landlord (if you have one) or calling a plumber. This will force the water.</p>

<p>Some apartment buildings have a central boiler that provides hot water to every unit. Let’s take a closer look at apartment plumbing. Sometimes the hot water will return.
