<p>So if you don�t end up getting an apartment—and the landlord never put it in writing that the application fee was nonrefundable—it�s within your rights to ask for the money back. Replied over 6 years ago. Almost every place i see has a no security deposit, $500 move in fee or $250 move in fee per adult. (the brokerage i’m.</p>

<p>Beside above, are admin fees for apartments refundable? I would always advertise that the application fee would be applied to the move in fees if they qualified. Replied over 6 years ago. I was just apartment hunting. An application fee is intended to cover the cost of running a credit and background check on you, the prospective tenant.</p>

<p>Pay with credit or debit card through a secure payment site. There are some cases in which you�ll be refunded the application fee but it�s very situational. If you spend less than what was charged in the application fee, then you must refund the difference. My wife and i loved one apartment, but it was first months rent, $500 move.</p>

<p>Pay with credit or debit card through a secure payment site. You�ll submit this payment with the rest of your rental application. And since you’ve already entered your information, it will only take a few clicks to apply to several more participating rentals (the participating rentals will have a green “apply now” button on.

<p>Anyways, it totally depends on the landlord when it comes to what the fee is. Apply early as applications are accepted year round. Knowing state regulations before you collect a california rental application fee will help you to avoid a costly legal issue. Again, the rules are different in different areas, so before applying for an apartment, read the fine.</p>

<p>You may not charge an application fee if there are no vacancies at the time.
