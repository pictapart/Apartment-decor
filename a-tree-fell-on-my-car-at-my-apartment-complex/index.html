<h3 id="your-next-step-should-be-to-remove-any-debris-thats-on-your-car">Your next step should be to remove any debris that’s on your car.</h3><p>If your parked on the street and a branch snaps off from a large tree leaning over somebody else�s fence and lands on your car, you�re eligible to apply for premises liability. Here you have to be ready to prove that the tree was in a weakened condition for some reason (such as age, disease, or a bad root system), and the neighbor knew about it but was negligent in failing.
